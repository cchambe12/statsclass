# 1
# Ti -> 1 = schools with vending machines
#       0 = schools without vending machines
# i = children
# yi = B0 + B1Ti + B2xi + error
# xi = weight/health prior to going to school
# There would have to be an even number of students spread between 0 and 1 schools
# and they should be randomly selected. This is assuming schools have similar demographics
# and that there is an even vending machine to child ratio.
